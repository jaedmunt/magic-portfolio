The energy landscape is evolving and small modular reactors (SMRs) are an extremely promising frontier.

As we grapple with the dual challenges of increasing energy demand and the urgent need for decarbonisation, SMRs represent a paradigm shift in nuclear energy.

Unlike their behemoth predecessors, these compact reactors are designed for scalability, flexibility, and rapid deployment.

The global SMR market is projected to reach $18.8 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 15.8% from 2020 to 2030.

SMRs can be added incrementally to meet growing energy needs. The smaller size means lower upfront investment and modular design means quicker assembly and installation.

They also feature passive safety features, reducing the risk of accidents. They are suitable for various applications, from powering remote communities to desalination plants.

Tech giants are also on board. Amazon's recent $500 million investment in X-energy underscores the growing interest in this technology. Microsoft has partnered with TerraPower, while Google's parent company Alphabet has invested in Commonwealth Fusion Systems.

As always, regulation is a necessary safeguard, and existing regulations are tailored for large reactors and need adaptation.

They haven't nailed long-term storage yet (quite important for radioactive byproducts).

But they're destined to do well. The clean baseload power generated complements intermittent renewable sources like wind and solar which have caused concerns during energy supply issues. Especially in the UK where the the sun shines twice a year and the wind only blows on the tallest hills or directly at you, magically, when you are completely surrounded by buildings.

With several designs nearing commercial readiness and increasing government support worldwide, we may soon see these miniature marvels powering our cities, industries, and space exploration endeavours.
