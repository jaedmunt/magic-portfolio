## Introduction

I have witnessed the rise of lab-grown diamonds[^1] first-hand. Working in a retail diamond merchant, management’s attitude has largely mirrored that of other stakeholders in the diamond supply chain who are slow to pitch the benefits of lab-grown in the same way they would natural product, or downright ignoring or detracting from their benefits.

There are clearly benefits, but:

- Are customers aware of the benefits and costs of natural and man-made diamonds?
- Do lab-grown diamonds align with the values of their responsible purchasers?

In this article, I explore a few potential causes of the growth of lab-grown and try to relate them to my first-hand experiences.

I then aim to offer a balanced view of lab-grown diamonds, and suggest why one of the 4 Cs, clarity (for consumers), is necessary for natural and man-made products to coexist. I evaluate this strategy, interpreting their actions and the impact of measures taken in response by natural diamond producers.

I will finally suggest my own alternative response to the lab-grown phenomenon, and comment on the attitudes of lab-grown adopters.

## “Do you have lab-grown?”

We have a few lab-grown, but the interest in them is far surpassing the stock we have in our windows. They represent, perhaps, less than 1% of the stock on show, yet I went from maybe 1–2 enquiries a week to the same per day for myself alone, as a conservative estimate.

It seems clear that sustainability-conscious consumers are behind the growth of lab-grown diamonds—favouring a seemingly ethical, environmentally conscious product[^2], lower prices[^3] (30–50% less), and “higher quality” (value for money).

## What changed?

I believe the catalyst is a mix of social change and consumer awareness, particularly amongst Millennials[^4]. I believe the sudden increase in adoption is a result of a few factors:

1. **Diamonds are an emotional purchase**[^5]—and an expensive one. They are a gift to express love and arguably a sacrificial symbol. “I will hurt my bank balance for you” (‘at least 2 months salary’ of it). Many modern couples are less bound to traditional gender roles, having a more equal say and responsibility for household finances[^6], and more open to move in together early, and/or before marriage. Buying a ring is more of an ‘us’ than a ‘me’ decision today than it was in the past, and both parties will bear the cost whether directly or indirectly. Amidst high inflation and cost of living crises, couples are perhaps more measured in what is important to spend on and more open to communicating about their wants compared to their needs. They may even see it as a mutual service to choose lab-grown if it means a better quality in other aspects of life. Due to them being the same, and often better value for money[^7], it isn’t apparent that they are sacrificing anything.

2. **Doing ‘good things’ makes us feel good. Being seen doing good things makes us feel even better.** Many want to contribute to saving the world, or at least making it a better place through their spending, but are not willing to look bad doing it. Despite lab-grown availability, their rise has been quite recent. Lab-grown have captured 20% of all diamond sales in 2024 compared to less than 1% in 2015[^8]. This social aspect has been a driving force behind other trends such as environmentally friendly travel. Now that lab-grown are popular, many feel comfortable accessing the benefits without the undertones about commitment which made it a risky decision before, because they see themselves as making the world a better place. Everyone wants a deal, but nobody wants to appear cheap. Little is considered as to the actual cost of a lab-grown diamond here[^9]—as long as the popular opinion is that they are sustainable.

Regardless, consumers are steadily drawing their own conclusions, and the gap in education from natural producers seeking to maintain their supremacy means consumers are getting the message from lab-grown advocates which, reasonably, are going to highlight the positive aspects, without considering the costs, both private and social.

## Mixed stones = mixed messages

The rise of lab-grown comes despite industry efforts to curtail interest. Failing this, there has been effort to influence how they are positioned in the market.

**Lightbox** is a great example of this[^10]: a De Beers brand taking the initiative of offering lab-grown, but with a few key differences.

- They come without a certificate offering (arguing that this confuses the customer on the value and rarity of a man-made item).
- Designs are marketed as everyday accessories rather than symbols of lifelong love or rare and exquisite pieces of fine jewellery.

I believe these conflicting positions, and inconsistency in messaging, have made the conscious consumer more skeptical of natural diamonds, and more open to exploring lab-grown.

Early adoption often includes information gaps. Consumers have not yet had time to understand the differences between lab and natural, and their respective pros and pitfalls[^11]. The information gap has been filled by those with incentives to push for lab-grown diamonds.

Similarly, often natural takes precedence for retailers and others in the supply chain. Both the familiarity and higher price point make them attractive to sell over the incoming alternative. This is a perfectly reasonable position.

However, seeking not to miss out on this growing section of the market, retailers have cautiously adopted lab-grown and added it to their offering, although much remains on small consignments.

## A glitch in the matrix

Addition by natural producers, distributors, and retailers of lab-grown diamonds to their inventory, to me, represents a thread pull that could unravel a century of marketing for the diamond industry. The first thing that comes to mind is the scene in *The Wizard of Oz* when the wizard is busily engaged with obscuring himself from view when the illusion of the great and powerful begins to wane.

If lab-grown are truly the same as diamonds, if your partner doesn’t mind and in fact advocates for saving money, and gets a stone which is bigger at a fraction of the price, and with a quality they would have to pay heavily for with natural, of course consumers are going to choose this.

Lab-grown and natural are destined to conflict because nobody’s story is straight. This is largely because of the accentuation and marketing around diamonds which is showing cracks. The diamond industry is built on story, and the lab-grown industry is too.

Whether the core reason or not, Lightbox was back-pedaled, and its closure was announced at a JCK Las Vegas event[^12].

### What stories?

- **Natural producers and merchants** state that diamonds are rare; that a diamond ring should hurt your pocket (cost 2 months salary); that a diamond should, for most consumers, be a special item bought once in a lifetime, as it is for a lifetime; and that your diamond has a wonderful story behind it and is unique (147 million carats were mined in 2018, many from open-pit mines and industrial-scale processing).

- **Lab-grown advocates** would argue that they are inherently sustainable; and that they exist to lower prices and improve quality and sustainability for consumers (around 2015–2016, lab-grown diamonds were 90% of the cost of a natural diamond, but have organically changed due to supply and demand factors over time).

It is going to be very hard to reconcile the two positions, supplying lab-grown and natural diamonds, without a tangible and substantial detriment to natural trade, because more transparency will be required than what most would like to allow. For example, around the way diamonds hold (or don’t hold) value... or how a diamond is actually mined (as in from a large open pit with industrial diggers)... or how rare diamonds actually are.

Lab-grown have ridden the wave of uninformed purchasers, first assuming lab-grown are more sustainable. Then many discovered the amount of energy used, which bothered them. Then came solar diamonds, an apparent fix. But there is one aspect of natural diamond supply that many conscious purchasers are missing: those producer nations whose governments, communities, and households thrive and survive on diamond trade.

## Natural diamonds = futures for millions

Consumers’ image of diamonds is often still one including a hefty price tag for producer nations. Images of conflict diamonds and unethical practices still capture a portion of the public’s imagination.

Significant improvements with the advent of the Kimberley Process, joint ventures and ownership in producer nations, and focus on CSR across the industry have resulted in widespread investment in education, infrastructure, and other important foci. Swift action in response to the Ukraine-Russia war is good evidence of the leaps that have been taken, even if at the industry’s detriment.

Diamonds support the development of producer nations. Over the years, there has been a growing stake in diamond production, and the proceeds are essential for funding infrastructure, education, and enabling 10 million employed workers around the world to achieve a livelihood. This aspect of natural diamonds is one I believe producers need to cast more visibility on. They need to lift these stories on high. A retail purchaser should not leave the store without a broader perspective on where their stone comes from, and how it contributes to the welfare of producer nations’ citizens.

The infrastructure is ready for this. Kimberley Certificates proved that this level of information is accessible to the consumer. Digitalised certificates/DIDs are one example of a way in which diamanteers can share the details of diamonds with a modern audience. This should not just be a compliance point, but a chance to tell the true story of how diamonds bring whole nations into the future, and support millions of lives.

While it might have ended up as a stunning piece in a high-end collection, it is called ‘the Queen of the Kalahari’ and not ‘Shirley Bassey’s Diamond Jewelry’. This naming convention honors the origin of the diamond, emphasizing its roots in the local geography rather than just its final destination or owner. When buyers choose a natural diamond, they are not only acquiring a beautiful stone but also forming a connection with the people and places that brought it to life, furthering their prosperity and development. What could be more socially responsible and conscious than this?

In time, as with all finite resources, these nations who are heavily dependent on diamonds, such as Botswana, will be able to diversify their economies. Until then, diamonds are a lifeline and chance to develop their economies.

Buyers can and should make responsible purchasing decisions, but they must be informed of the entire picture. Natural producers should put aside their pride and be transparent about the differences between natural and lab-grown diamonds. Let consumers decide, but ensure they understand how the industry supports poverty alleviation, income generation, education, and prosperity.
