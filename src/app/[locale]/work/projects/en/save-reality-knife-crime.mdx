When I started working on [www.save-reality.co.uk](http://www.save-reality.co.uk), it was more than just a project—it was a response to something deeply personal and profoundly urgent. Living in Nottingham, the shadow of knife crime is not just a statistic but a lived reality for many young people. The ripple effects of violence are everywhere—families torn apart, communities gripped by fear, and futures extinguished far too soon. I wanted to do something meaningful, something that could provide both awareness and tangible action.

Save Reality became my way of answering this call.

## The Vision

At its heart, Save Reality is about more than just raising awareness of knife crime. It is about equipping people, especially young people, with the tools to make better choices and to build stronger, safer networks. It is about changing the narrative from fear to resilience, from isolation to community, and from reactive solutions to proactive empowerment.

As the project’s Treasurer and a contributing member, I realised early on that education and engagement would be central to our mission. But education alone would not be enough. We needed something interactive, something that did not just speak to young people but invited them to take part.

## The Webapp - Turning Pledges Into Impact

The idea for the webapp came from a simple truth. Change starts with individual action, but it spreads through networks. This led to the creation of an online platform where students can pledge against carrying a knife. Each pledge is not just a promise. It is a visible step toward breaking the cycle of violence.

The app does not stop there. Every pledge is displayed on a network graph, creating a living, breathing representation of change. As students pledge, they can see the web grow, a visual reminder that they are not alone in choosing a better path. It is a small step, but one that turns individual commitment into collective impact.

## Building for Action

The webapp is not just a tool; it is a perfect opportunity to apply technology to a real-world problem. It embodies Save Reality’s ethos by offering education about the root causes of knife crime, the influence of peer networks, and the devastating consequences of violence. It provides visibility through a public commitment to rejecting violence, reinforced by seeing others take the same stand. It also fosters connection, offering a way to visualise the strength of positive networks while countering the harmful influence of negative ones.

Working on this app challenged me to think beyond the technical side of things. It inspired me to make the experience accessible, engaging, and impactful. My goal was to create a tool that not only informs but also empowers individuals to take meaningful action.

## Why It Matters

Save Reality is not just about tackling knife crime. It is about addressing the fears, pressures, and choices that lead to it. Fear is often the invisible thread that binds young people to this cycle, fear of vulnerability, of not fitting in, or of being defenceless. By offering a platform where they can make a stand and see that stand reflected in their community, we begin to unravel that fear.

Knife crime is never a solo act. It is a community issue. But that also means the solution is a community effort. Save Reality is my way of contributing to that solution, a way to remind young people that they have a choice, that their voices matter, and that their networks can shape a future built on resilience, not violence.

## Looking Ahead

As Save Reality grows, so does my hope for what we can achieve together. I see this project as a spark, one that can inspire others to join, to act, and to build a Nottingham where every young person feels safe, supported, and empowered.

In the end, Save Reality is not just about knives or pledges or apps. It is about people, working together, learning together, and refusing to let fear define their future. And that, for me, is worth every ounce of effort.
