title: "The Future Will Be Small, Modular, and Nuclear"
summary: The energy landscape is evolving and small modular reactors (SMRs) are an extremely promising frontier. As we grapple with the dual challenges of increasing energy demand and the urgent need for decarbonisation, SMRs represent a paradigm shift in nuclear energy. Unlike their behemoth predecessors, these compact reactors are designed for scalability, flexibility, and rapid deployment.
