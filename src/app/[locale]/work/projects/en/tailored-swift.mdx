## My Attempt to Appeal to Pop Culture

**Tailored Swift** is an open-source project designed to make voice cloning efficient and effective by providing scripts that cover all necessary phonetic sounds with minimal audio input. The repository includes tools for phoneme extraction and audio analysis, ensuring high-quality voice replication.

The example given is with **only four half-minute samples**, out of the available 25. It is very accurate with only 2 minutes of audio. Re-reading the script drastically increases quality—especially if intonation, pace, etc., are varied across your submissions. This is demonstrated in Example 2.

Voice cloning has applications in entertainment, customer service, and assistive technology. High-quality voice cloning depends on diverse and rich phonetic input. Tailored Swift's scripts ensure that even short recordings can produce versatile, high-fidelity voice clones.

**TL;DR:** Your voice clone (TAILORED) quickly (SWIFT).

**Languages offered in the initial commit:** English, German, Spanish, French.

**Fun Fact:** This article will be pasted in with a clone trained on my voice. Visit `/recordings/examples/english` to hear the output!

[GitHub - jaedmunt/Tailored_Swift](https://github.com/jaedmunt/Tailored_Swift): Want a high-accuracy voice clone quickly? Welcome to Tailored Swift! This collection offers phonetically balanced scripts in multiple languages.

## The Challenge: Authentic Voice Cloning

Voice cloning requires capturing the full range of phonetic sounds to accurately replicate a person’s voice. Traditional methods often need extensive recordings, which can be time-consuming and impractical. The goal is to create a script that includes all phonemes, allowing for high-quality voice cloning with the least amount of input.

## What Tailored Swift Provides

Comprehensive phonetic scripts in multiple languages. Each script is meticulously designed to cover vowels, diphthongs, and consonants, ensuring that every essential sound is captured.

The repo is public, so if you want to contribute, you are welcome to do so. Just follow the file structure and guidance in the README, and expand the offering to your geography or one you are interested in.

## Examples from Different Languages

**English:**

- Vowels: "She sees the bee by the sea."
- Diphthongs: "They play by the bay every day."
- Consonants: "Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers."

**French:**

- Vowels: "La lune brille dans le ciel."
- Diphthongs: "Aujourd'hui, il fait beau."
- Consonants: "Le chat dort sur le canapé."

**German:**

- Vowels: "Die Biene fliegt."
- Diphthongs: "Mein Freund heißt Klaus."
- Consonants: "Zwei Zebras sind im Zoo."

**Spanish:**

- Vowels: "Mi mamá me mima."
- Diphthongs: "Hoy voy a bailar."
- Consonants: "El gato gruñe."

## The Linguistic Foundation

Phonetics, the study of human speech sounds, is crucial for voice cloning. Phonetic coverage ensures that all distinct phonemes (sounds) of a language are included, enabling accurate voice replication.

- **Vowels:** Sounds made without significant constriction in the vocal tract.
- **Diphthongs:** Complex vowel sounds that transition within the same syllable.
- **Consonants:** Sounds produced with varying degrees of constriction in the vocal tract.

These are broken down into:

- **Monophthongs:** [iː] (heed), [ɪ] (hid), [e] (bed), [æ] (cat), [ɑː] (father), [ɒ] (pot), [ɔː] (thought), [ʊ] (foot), [uː] (food), [ʌ] (strut), [ɜː] (nurse), [ə] (comma)
- **Diphthongs:** [eɪ] (face), [aɪ] (price), [ɔɪ] (choice), [aʊ] (mouth), [oʊ] (goat), [ɪə] (near), [eə] (square), [ʊə] (cure)
- **Consonants:**
  - **Stops:** Voiceless [p] (pat), [t] (tap), [k] (cat); Voiced [b] (bat), [d] (dad), [g] (game)
  - **Fricatives:** Voiceless [f] (fan), [θ] (think), [s] (sip), [ʃ] (ship), [h] (hat); Voiced [v] (van), [ð] (this), [z] (zip), [ʒ] (measure)
  - **Affricates:** Voiceless [tʃ] (chin); Voiced [dʒ] (gin)
  - **Nasals:** [m] (man), [n] (no), [ŋ] (sing)
  - **Approximants:** [r] (red), [j] (yet)
  - **Lateral Approximant:** [l] (led)

## Significance and Applications

Voice cloning has applications in entertainment, customer service, and assistive technology. High-quality voice cloning depends on diverse and rich phonetic input. Tailored Swift's scripts ensure that even short recordings can produce versatile, high-fidelity voice clones.

Hopefully, this project skims some time down and makes cloning easier and more effective.

**Happy cloning!**
